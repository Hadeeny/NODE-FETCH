# NODE-FETCH

This uses nodejs to fetch posts from a json placeholder without the axios or node-fetch package

The posts gotten from the API is written in a post.txt file contained inside a result folder, both of which were created using the node FS module
You will find the result folder in this repo.
You can test the code by downloading the required dependencies and delete the result folder.
After runnning the code, the result folder along with post.txt will be recreated
It works like magic
